# python-challenge

For the PyBank challenge I had help from an Ask BCS tutor who showed me how to skip the first row with  first_row = next(csv_reader) and explained to me how to find the average change in profit from there. I looped through each row and found the profit change, using that to find the greatest increase and decrease in profit as well as the average change in profit. I then printed the analysis and exported it to a txt file.

Pypoll was done similarly with the help of a tutor getting me started. He walked me through creating a function to find the percentage of votes each candidate had. I formatted the data as close as I could to what the assignment called for, but unfortunately I ran out of time and was not able to get it to look as it does in the assignment page.
